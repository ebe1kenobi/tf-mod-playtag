A new Game Mod to Play tag. Each round a player has It, and it must touch another player to pass It. All the player alive at the end of the round gain 1 point.
- No Arrow
- No kill on stomping
- Treasure chest will not give Arrows
- the player can be killed by the environment
- The shield can protect from It

In other versus mode, a treasure chest can give a hidden Play Tag item in the form of other items (arrow, orb, ...), you can't know if it is it or not :) It will spawn only once per match.
When a Player will take the false items, the playtag mode will activate for 10 seconds, then the normal mode will be back.
